# Ghosts Checksum Fixer
A command-line checksum fixer for Call of Duty: Ghosts PC Savegame.svg files. Works on *PC only*. Might work on Xbox One and PS4, but there is no way to test that at this moment in time.

Support for Xbox 360, PS3, and WiiU *may* be added in the future.

Please be aware that this does not work for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The save header is a slightly different size. I will be making a separate tool for those games. 

I have no idea about other Call of Duty games (such as Modern Warfare Remastered, Advanced Warfare, or Black Ops 1/2). Call of Duty 4 and 5 do not use checksummed saves.

## Usage

After fixing, both the original and new checksums will be displayed for your reference.
